Citing metadata
---------------

This repository contains the necessary metadata to cite me consistently.

The ``mailmap`` file contains lines that, if added to your repository's
`.mailmap <https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-check-mailmap>`_ file, will
map any email address I've committed with since ~2010.

The ``zenodo.json`` file contains a ``person_or_org`` object, defined in
https://zenodo.org/schemas/records/record-v1.0.0.json. This object may
be included as a contributor, creator, or similar field in a
`.zenodo.json <https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo/issues/1421>`_ file.

In both cases, I use the form of my name I prefer for citations, which
makes it easier to use scripts to reorder authorship order by some
repository metric. For examples, see:

* pybids_

This data may be copied into your project without my express consent,
although I may ask you to remove me from your project.
